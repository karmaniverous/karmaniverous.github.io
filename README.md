# Documentation Root

This repo provides a common root for generated repository documentation at the `docs.karmanivero.us` subdomain.

When GitGub Pages are enabled on repository `foo`, its content will be displayed at `https://docs.karmanivero.us/foo`.

Users who navigate to the documentaion root at `https://docs.karmanivero.us` will be redirected to the main site at `https://karmanivero.us`.
